# AutomationTesting

## What is Automation Testing 
* Automated testing is a software testing technique that automates the process of validating the functionality of software and ensures it meets requirements before being released into production.

## Benifts
* With the help of automation tool we can write test script which automatically  run our test cases without human intervention.
* It save out time.


## What is Selenium?
* Selenium is powerful, opensource framework that enables automation testing of web application.
* It is used for non functional testing. 
* Its latest version is 4.7.0
* Browsers supported by Selenium are Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox and Safari.
* Supported OS by selenium Window, Linux.
* Supported Programming Language - Python, Java, C#, PHP, Perl and Ruby
* Selenium can be used to automate functional tests and can be integrated with automation test tools such as Maven, Jenkins, & Docker to achieve continuous testing. 
* It can also be integrated with tools such as TestNG, & JUnit for managing test cases and generating reports.

## Automation Testing tools which are used for non-functional automation:
*Load Runner, provided by HP.
*JMeter, provided by Apache.

## What is QTP?
* QTP(Quick Test Professional) is an alternate of selenium.
* Automation functional Testing tool.

## What is SDLC?
* SDLC is the process of deloping softwares. There are different phases in SDLC and each phase has various activities. Requirement phase, Design phase, build/development phase, testing phase, deployment phase, maintainance phase.

## Level of Testing?
* In software testing, we have four different levels of testing, which are as discussed below:
    - Unit tesing : In it each unit or component of a software is tested
    - Integration : In it we test more than one component or unit of a software at a time. We mainly test data flow from one component to another component
    - System testing : In it we test the whole system and its functional and non functional requirements.
    - Acceptance testing : It ensures that whether our system is up to our quirements or not

## SDLC Models
* Waterwall
* Spiral
* Prototype
* V-model

## Types of Testing
* Manuall Testing - Test case is executed by the human being 
* Automation Testing - 

## Testing 
* Black Box - Black box testing is a technique of software testing which examines the functionality of software without peering into its internal structure or coding
* White Box -
